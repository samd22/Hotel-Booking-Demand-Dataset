# Hotel-Booking-Demand-Dataset
I found a Hotel Booking Demand dataset on Kaggle and used Python Pandas to clean and explore the data for productive insights. In addition, I created a model to predict whether a potential guest will cancel their reservation. The dataset and additional information can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand
